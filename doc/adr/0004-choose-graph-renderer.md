## Context

As ADR is in Markdown format, and it is supposed to be stored in a git repo, we need a compatible vizualization graph renderer.  
We need too to browse ADR in a simple way.

## Decision

Use mermaid graph generator, with click event.

## Consequences

ADR List command may be useless, as TOC generator.
